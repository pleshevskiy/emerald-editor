Universal markup editor for React based on configurable components.

## About

This the editor, initially created for mailing service to easily create
templates. But we decide to create universal editor for any markup language.
You can configure own components and set up your custom editor.

## Motivation

I wanted react DND editor with possibility to configure all blocks that we can
drag and drop. The editor should be able to change html structure, styles for
each blocks. And also the editor should returns html and styles as result for
integration with API. I didn't find it and decided to create it myself.
